I’m excited to share my latest project: a comprehensive Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard! 🛒📊

By analyzing over $1.2M in sales data, I've visualized key business drivers ranging from outlet location efficiency to consumer preferences in product fat content. This project highlights how data storytelling can turn raw retail numbers into actionable business insights.

Key Takeaways: 🔹 Tier 3 locations are driving the highest revenue growth. 🔹 Medium-sized outlets strike the best balance between size and sales volume. 🔹 Fruits & Snacks remain the core pillars of the "Last Minute" delivery model.

I built this using [Insert Tool, e.g., Power BI / Tableau] to practice data modeling, DAX, and UI/UX design in dashboards. I would love to hear your feedback! 📈
